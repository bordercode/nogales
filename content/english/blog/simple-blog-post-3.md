title: Four Stage Mennonite Migration model
---

## Four-Stage Mennonite Migration Model” (FSMM).


```A recurring model for the creation of new rural communities.```


The Model consistently involved a four-stage cycle. 

>First, a pioneer stage of ```colony integration```, followed by the second stage of ```economic activity 
consolidation``` tailored to the local and regional market conditions. Then, the third stage of 
```colony growth``` unfolded in parallel with an intensive use of resources. ```A fourth expansion 
stage``` was characterized by the search for additional suitable land for the next 
Auswanderung.
