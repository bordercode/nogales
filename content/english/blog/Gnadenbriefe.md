### Local disconfort and need for additional Lands.

```
In the case of Mexico, historical evidence in the Works by Carmen Collado 
documents President Obregón´s  unusual land dealings related to close family members.   
```

>Land dealings in which the lines between politics and business would be freely crossed, unveiling the plutocratic relations that prevailed in Mexico.

According to Sawatzky (1971), ```John F. D Wiebe``` is credited for being the contact
between the Mexican government and the Mennonite community in the purchase of the
needed land. Wiebe contacted ```Arturo José Braniff```, son of Thomas Braniff, a prominent figure and member of the economic elite from the Porfirian era. Also, “historical evidence indicates that Arturo Braniff founded a company to manage and sell land with ```Federico A.Luna,``` an individual close to President Álvaro Obregón” (Collado, 2012, p. 742)


#### Once again locals express an initial disconfort.


>Governor […] ```Ignacio Enriquez does not want any more Mennonite settlers
in the state``` until the land is given to the habitants of the towns since he
considers it one-sided that foreigners are given preferential treatment, as has
been the case so far, while Mexicans are deprived in their homeland of rights
that citizens of other countries readily obtain. […] He added that Chihuahua
landowners have found in this procedure how to leave our compatriots
without land by selling their latifundios in good conditions to foreigners
(Aboites, 1995, p. 176).


#### The integration issue. The Mexican stage.

```
...As documented by the Mexican newspaper Excélsior 
on March 6, 1925, under the title “Coming from Canada”: 
```

>Mennonite Colonists are not considered as a good acquisition. Persons
informed in the matter estimate that the colonization by Mennonites either is
negative or, if not, nonetheless does not benefit the country at all. Given that
these people live in communities absolutely isolated from the rest of the
population, without any contact with native people, even placing between
them and the inhabitants of the country, the unsurpassable barrier of their
entirely exotic costumes and religion (Excélsior, 1925, p.13).
