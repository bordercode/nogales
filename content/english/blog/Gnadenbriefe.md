Text de Ceferno.

Work by Carmen Collado documents unusual land dealings of President Obregón close family members  

Land dealings in which the lines between politics and business would be freely crossed, unveiling the plutocratic relations that prevailed in Mexico

“historical evidence indicates that Arturo Braniff founded a company to manage and sell land with Federico A. Luna, an individual close to President Álvaro Obregón” (Collado, 2012, p. 742).
