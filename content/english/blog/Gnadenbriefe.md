```
In the case of Mexico, historical evidence in the Works by Carmen Collado 
documents President Obregón´s  unusual land dealings related to close family members.   
```

>Land dealings in which the lines between politics and business would be freely crossed, unveiling the plutocratic relations that prevailed in Mexico.

According to Sawatzky (1971), ```John F. D Wiebe``` is credited for being the contact
between the Mexican government and the Mennonite community in the purchase of the
needed land. Wiebe contacted ```Arturo José Braniff```, son of Thomas Braniff, a prominent figure and member of the economic elite from the Porfirian era. Also, “historical evidence indicates that Arturo Braniff founded a company to manage and sell land with ```Federico A.Luna,``` an individual close to President Álvaro Obregón” (Collado, 2012, p. 742)


#### Once again locals express an initial tension.


>Governor […] Ignacio Enriquez does not want any more Mennonite settlers
in the state until the land is given to the habitants of the towns since he
considers it one-sided that foreigners are given preferential treatment, as has
been the case so far, while Mexicans are deprived in their homeland of rights
that citizens of other countries readily obtain. […] He added that Chihuahua
landowners have found in this procedure how to leave our compatriots
without land by selling their latifundios in good conditions to foreigners
(Aboites, 1995, p. 176).
