title: Environment as a Migration determinant 
---

The Search for New Agricultural Lands as a Determinant for International Migration:
The Mennonite Diaspora.


> To approach the migration process leading to the establishment of the Chihuahua colony
in Bolivia, it is rather important to consider some common determinants, at least from two
previous stages of international Mennonite migration: from Russia to Canada and from
Canada to Mexico, which led to the founding of the Chihuahua colony in Bolivia.

This organized 4,305 miles journey across the continent into South America started
during 1967 and 1968 with the establishment of four settlements in the proximity of Santa
Cruz City, Bolivia. These “mother”2
colonies —named Riva Palacios, Santa Rita,
Sommerfeld, and Swift Current— can be considered the starting point of a massive group
migration that Mennonite farmers have undertaken to open new agricultural frontiers in
Bolivia.


The Russia-Canada migration began with the establishment of the Chortiz colony in 1873
in the newly created Province of Manitoba in the Canadian prairie region. This pioneer
settlement in an area known as the West Reserve, established by Mennonite immigrants from Russia,
is recognized as the first permanent agricultural settlement on the fertile open prairie in Western Canada (De Lisle, 1974).
