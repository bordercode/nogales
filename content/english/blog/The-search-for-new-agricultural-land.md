title: Environment as a Migration determinant

The Search for New Agricultural Lands as a Determinant for International Migration:
The Mennonite Diaspora.


> To approach the migration process leading to the establishment of the Chihuahua colony
in Bolivia, it is rather important to consider some common determinants, at least from two
previous stages of international Mennonite migration: from Russia to Canada and from
Canada to Mexico, which led to the founding of the Chihuahua colony in Bolivia.

This organized **4,305 miles journey** across the continent into South America started
during **1967 and 1968** with the establishment of four settlements in the proximity of Santa
Cruz City, Bolivia. These “mother”
colonies —named Riva Palacios, Santa Rita,
Sommerfeld, and Swift Current— can be considered the starting point of a massive group
migration that Mennonite farmers have undertaken to open new agricultural frontiers in
Bolivia.


**The Russia-Canada migration** began with the establishment of the Chortiz colony in **1873**
in the newly created Province of Manitoba in the Canadian prairie region. This pioneer
settlement in an area known as the West Reserve, established by Mennonite immigrants from Russia,
is recognized as the first permanent agricultural settlement on the fertile open prairie in Western Canada (De Lisle, 1974).

Mennonite economic motivations represent a controversial, less documented
aspect of the Mennonite farmer image and one, arguably with profound implications to
understand its diaspora.

**After 48 years of following a closed-colony settlement pattern in the Canadian prairies,**
the Mennonite community was confronted with two key realities that ultimately led to their
migration in 1921. On the one hand, the pressure for social integration imposed by a mainly
Anglo-Canadian host society, particularly in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba,
and on the other, the need for additional land to further expand their closed-settlement model.

> In practice, they function as a micro-society on their
own, isolated from the cultural customs of the host society except for commercial activity.

The Canadian society perspective: 

*“the loyal
Canadian feels that the Mennonite are slackers; they will not learn English, they have a
distinct religion and they would not assimilate with Canadians” (Friesen, 1934, p. 119).* 

>In 1919, the Canadian government explicitly prohibited further migration of Mennonites
to Canada (Warkentin, 1960), adding even more pressures to their plans to expand their
model of social organization in that North American country.

Not withstanding, Mennonite conservative leaders conducted a series of attempts to
persuade provincial governments. However, the authorities expressed that “a country within
a country was impossible to contemplate in Canada” (Sawatzky, 1971, p. 35).
