title: Environment as a Migration determinant

#### The Search for New Agricultural Lands as a Determinant for International Migration: The Mennonite Diaspora.


> To approach the migration process leading to the establishment of the Chihuahua colony
in Bolivia, it is rather important to consider some common determinants, at least from two previous stages of international Mennonite migration: from **Russia to Canada** and from **Canada to Mexico**, which led to the founding of **the Chihuahua colony in Bolivia.**

#### The Russia-Canada Auswanderung


``` The Russia-Canada migration ```
began with the establishment of ```the Chortiz colony``` in ```1873``` in the newly created Province of Manitoba in the Canadian prairie region. This pioneer settlement in an area known as ```the West Reserve```, established by Mennonite immigrants ```from Russia```, is recognized as the first permanent agricultural settlement on the fertile open prairie in Western Canada (De Lisle, 1974).

#### The settlers arrangements at arrival.

```
After 48 years of following a closed-colony settlement pattern
```
in the Canadian prairies, the Mennonite community was confronted with two key realities that ultimately led to their
migration in ```1921```. On the one hand, ```the pressure for social integration``` imposed by a mainly
```Anglo-Canadian host society```, particularly in the provinces of ```Saskatchewan and Manitoba,```
and on the other, ```the need for additional land to further expand their closed-settlement model.```

> In practice, they function as a micro-society on their
own, isolated from the cultural customs of the host society except for commercial activity.




### Local society preasures

The Canadian society perspective: 

```
"The loyal Canadian feels that the Mennonite are slackers; they will not 
learn English, they have a distinct religion and they would not assimilate 
with Canadians” (Friesen, 1934, p. 119).(see Thesis at the University of SasKatchewan. Ref. to Education.)
```



>In 1919, ```the Canadian government explicitly prohibited further migration of Mennonites to Canada``` (Warkentin, 1960), adding even more pressures to their plans to expand their
model of social organization in that North American country.

Not withstanding, Mennonite conservative leaders conducted a series of attempts to
persuade provincial governments. ```However, the authorities expressed that “a country within a country was impossible to contemplate in Canada”``` (Sawatzky, 1971, p. 35).

```toml
Mennonite economic motivations represent a controversial, less documented
aspect of the Mennonite farmer image and one, arguably with profound implications to
understand its diaspora.
