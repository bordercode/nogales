>In December of 1975, the Bolivian government signed the Supreme Act No. 13261, which
abrogated the previous 1962 legal arrangement acquired by the Mennonites. 

The 1975 Supreme Act included the following judgment:
Considering that ```Mennonite communities’ migration to the country was authorized in conditions contrary to the National Legislation and as a flagrant

respect to our institutions […]``` The Counsel of Ministries, decree: Article 1.
Abrogate Supreme Act 06030 of March 16, 1962 (Decreto Supremo No.
13261, 1975, p. 1).
