## Concluding remarks.

The evidence presented indicates that as migrants, ```Mennonites have developed a powerful
set of strategies that have been evolving, gaining from the experience of a mix of cultures
across countries.``` 

>In Latin American countries, particularly in their transition period from
Mexico to Bolivia, the Mennonite migration model has encountered social conditions that
allow it to flourish, making ```the Mennonite communities central players in a global food
production chain.```


Although, as farmers, their activities certainly have clear ```areas of
opportunity to advance towards more sustainable practices```, a focus on their socioorganizational model shows that:

>their productive pilgrimage reflects a shared goal founded
on solid grounds.
