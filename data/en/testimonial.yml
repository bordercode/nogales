      content : Indeed, the Mennonite immigrants […] expressed an almost obsessive interest in farmland. As immigrants, they debated its quality, and as farmers, they tested its potential. As neighbors, they treasured land if it was contiguous to the land of friends and relatives; as parents, they schemed for ways of acquiring more land. (Loewen, 2001, p. 70).
